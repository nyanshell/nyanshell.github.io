Finally, I just brewed another batch of ale after two years. I made this batch around May 2021. Due to some procrastination, I didn't write it down until now.

## Ingredient

- Yeast
  - [LALBREW CBC-1](https://www.lallemandbrewing.com/en/united-states/product-details/lalbrew-cbc-1/), 10g
  - LALVIN ICV-D47, 10g
- Malt
  - Thomas Fawcett Maris Otter Pale Ale 2kg
  - 2-Row Pale Ale Malt 2.5kg
- Hops
  - Amarillo, 13g
  - Galaxy, 6g
- Water 10L

## Procedure

### Brew day Checklist

- Wash the bucket & pot, equipment
- Wash the kitchen sink
- Prepare sanitizer
- Crush malt
- Pour malt into the bucket
- Boil water to 80℃
- Pour water into the bucket
- Mashing 1h
- Keep water in 65-68℃
- Mashing time: 1h
- Boiling 1h
- Take sample & measure SG
- Cool down, around 3 hours
- Melt yeast & add yeast

### Crushing the Malt (0504)

I intended to crushed the malt on this day. However, I spent over 1 hour on finding bolt for the lever stick of the malt crusher. Because I don't use it for a while, I can't find it anywhere. I tried use electric screw driver instead, unfortunately, the power isn't enough. Finally I found a proper bolt in my skateboard's spare parts.

But I also feel hard to turn the grinder and spent ten minutes to crush 4.5kg malts.

### Mashing & Boiling (0505)

#### Mashing

- T+0, added 5L water into crushed malt, 69°C after added.
- T+20min, 69°C.
- T+30min, 63.2°C.
- T+40min, add another 5L water, 69°C(surface) after added,  63°C on bottom of the bucket.
- T+70min，60°C-64°C, stop mashing.

#### Boiling

- 16:30, start boiling the wort.
- 16:50, boiling.
- 16:58, hot break.
- 17:01, first hopping, added Amarillo hops.
- 17:20, second hopping, added Galaxy hops.
- 17:33, stop heating.

Start Gravity: BRIX: >25, gravity: >1.1057 (refractometer's range exceeded).

### Adding yeast (0506)

Environment temperature: 25.1°C, humidity: 67.9%.

Because I didn't have any device to cool down the wort instantly, I kept wort in the sealed pot overnight and added yeast the next morning. I chose two high alcohol tolerance yeast in this batch. Because room temperature isn't in LALBREW CBC-1's primary fermentation range (20°C), I added one pack of LALVIN ICV-D47 to raise the ABV. However, both were not in the ideal fermentation temperature while using.

### Fermentation (0507-0529)

Environment temperature: 26.3°C, humidity: 63.2%.

Compared with the previous batch, fermentation was not fierce on the first two days. Even though the airlock keeps bubbling during the two weeks.

### Bottling (0529)

Ordinary sanitizing and bottling process. I bought half a dozen 300ml Heineken lager beer to reuse its bottle. However, when I started capping, I found this kind of bottle couldn't be recapped with the hand capper. The raised part of the bottleneck is too thin for the hand capper. Wondering I didn't notice it before. Luckily, I have enough Chimay and Delirium bottles.

Bottling day gravity BRIX: 14.5, gravity: 1.0590, ABV 6.13%.

## Taste & Conclusion

I opened up a bottle after two weeks, its tastes just like the previous batch in two years but more a strong yeast flavor. The ABV is enough, with a slight sweetness from maltose and a little thickness. However, the secondary fermentation was not succeeded. The beer totally didn't get carbonated. There is still no foam in the bottle after two months of aging.

**Taste after half-year**: The body seems to become more strong and drier. The BRIX in the last bottle is 13.6, slightly higher than fresh bottled.

Maybe next time, I need to start brewing at a proper room temperature. According to the last few trials, a fierce fermentation in the first 1-2 days always got carbonated results.
